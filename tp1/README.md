 - This project represents a room with a table, a window and some decoration.
 - Since it is someones birthday, there are balloons, and most importantly a birthday cake.
 - The illumination consists on a light at the top, the candle's flame and the sunset light coming from the window.
 - Every object on the scene receives and casts shadows.
 - There is a happy birthday mode in the interface, which lightens the candle's flame and turns the lights off.
