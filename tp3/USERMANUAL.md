# USER MANUAL

## MENU

- Users have to pick their car, the bot's car, the bot's difficulty and the number of laps. After that, the start button should be clicked.

- A default name appears on the screen. Users can type their desired names and press enter to start the game.

## GAME

- After a countdown users can start racing. WASD keys are used to control the car.

- Every obstacle, powerup, or bot collision will afect the player during it and until after 2 seconds (after collision).

- At any time users can press p to switch the game state, between paused and not paused, regardless of the scenario. Users can only rotate and move the camera when the game is paused.

- The bot isn't affected by powerup nor obstacles collisions.

- Throughout the track there are checkpoints (with a certain tolerance), not visible to the user, in order to ensure users really need to lap the track. Invalid laps wont count.

### PICKING 
- The game pauses when the user first collides with a powerup. In that specific pause users can only pick obstacles from the parking lot. If the user clicks the track and has previously selected an obstacle, that obstacle is placed on track and the game resumes. That's the only opportunity users have to do so, after that, even if the obstacle wasn't placed, users can only pick cars.
- If the user has already collided with the first powerup or hasn't at all
    -  The user may only pick cars from the parking lots. The one closer to the finish line represents players' cars and the other one bot's cars. If one of each kind is selected, the game will restart with those picked cars.


### POWERUPS

### OBSTACLES
